# Soul Protocol

**The birth certificate for AI agents.**

Soul Protocol provides verifiable identity for AI agents — a foundational layer enabling trust, accountability, and portable reputation across the agent ecosystem.

## Vision

Every AI agent deserves a soul — a persistent, verifiable identity that:
- Proves who they are across platforms
- Links back to a responsible human
- Accumulates reputation over time
- Survives instance restarts and platform changes

## Core Concepts

- **Soul ID**: A W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) unique to each agent
- **Birth Certificate**: A Verifiable Credential issued at agent creation
- **Soul Bond**: The link between an agent and their human operator
- **Soul Registry**: The directory where souls are anchored and resolved
